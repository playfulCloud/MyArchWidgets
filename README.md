# My Arch widgets

## Overview
My Arch widgets are designed to provide an enhanced user experience by offering a set of interactive widgets for the Arch Linux environment, tailored to improve the functionality and usability of the Aylur GTK Shell.

## Features
- **Audio Control**: Manage your audio settings with ease. Adjust volume, mute/unmute, and view sound levels through a clean and minimalistic widget.
- **Battery Indicator**: Keep track of your laptop's battery life with our straightforward battery widget.
- **Date and Time**: Stay up to date with a simple glance at the top bar, displaying the current time and date.
- **Network Status**: At a quick look, check whether you are connected to the internet and monitor your connection status.

## Progress
The latest release has successfully integrated the audio control widget, enhancing the overall sound management experience within the shell environment. The functionality for volume control and muting has been a focus, ensuring that users have a hassle-free interaction.

## Usage
To interact with the widgets:
- **Audio Control**: Use the mouse scroll over the widget to adjust the volume, or click to mute/unmute.
- **Battery Indicator**: Simply hover over the battery icon to get more detailed information.
- **Date and Time**: An always-visible widget requires no interaction but can be customized in settings.
- **Network Status**: Hover to view connection details or click to open network settings.

## Upcoming Features
- **Brightness Control Module**: In the upcoming updates, we plan to implement a Brightness Control Module. This feature will allow users to adjust their screen brightness directly from the shell interface, providing a more complete control suite.

## Future Enhancements
We aim to continually enhance the My Arch widgets, ensuring each widget not only serves its primary function but also contributes to a coherent and functional desktop experience. Look forward to comprehensive updates to the audio module and the introduction of the new Brightness Control Module.
