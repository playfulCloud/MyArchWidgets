## Overview
My Arch widgets has successfully integrated a new feature: the Audio Module. This module enhances user interaction with the system's audio capabilities, providing a seamless and intuitive interface for managing sound settings.

## Features
- **Volume Control**: Users can easily adjust the volume with a simple and user-friendly interface.
- **Sound Indicators**: Current volume level is indicated visually, allowing for quick reference.
- **Mute Functionality**: The module allows users to mute and unmute the system sound with a single click or keypress.

## Progress
As of the latest update, we have successfully implemented the audio handling module. This component is designed to provide a streamlined experience for controlling audio levels within the Aylur GTK Shell environment.

## Usage
To interact with the audio module:
- **Increase Volume**: Scroll up on the audio icon or use designated volume up keys.
- **Decrease Volume**: Scroll down on the audio icon or use designated volume down keys.
- **Mute/Unmute**: Click on the audio icon or use the mute toggle key.

## Upcoming Features
- **Network Module**: The next step in the development of My Arch widgets is to implement the Network Module. This will provide users with the ability to manage their network connections, view status information, and adjust settings related to connectivity directly from the shell interface.

## Future Enhancements
The future roadmap includes enhancements to the audio module to make it even more robust and feature-rich, as well as expanding the shell's capabilities with the addition of the network module and other planned features.
